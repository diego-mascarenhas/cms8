## About CMS8

CMS8 is a web application with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [The PHP Framework for Web Artisans](https://laravel.com).
- [Build Scalable, High-Performance Web Applications](https://pixinvent.com/vuexy-bootstrap-html-admin-template).
- [GrapesJS, Web Builder Framework](https://grapesjs.com).
- [Laravel Sail & Docker](https://demos.pixinvent.com/vuexy-html-admin-template/documentation/laravel-sail-docker.html)

CMS8 is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
